Comments:	The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize
		the time of a computer client or server to another server
		or reference time source.
		
		Use /usr/local/etc/init.d/ntpd to start/stop/restart.
		The ntp.conf file is in /usr/local/etc.
		
		To synchronize with a GPS:
		1) Read http://gpsd.berlios.de/gpsd.html#ntp
		2) Start the gpsd daemon with the "-n" option.
		
		NOTE: Any time source specified in ntp.conf (GPS or otherwise)
		which is more than 1000s from the local time will be ignored.
		
		Use "ntpq -p" to check for synchronization. The reach column
		will be nonzero if a synchronization attempt was successful.
