Comments:	Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
		It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network.
		It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global DNS.
		The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines with
		DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured either in
		each host or in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports static and
		dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP/TFTP/PXE for network booting Dnsmasq is targeted
		at home networks using NAT and connected to the internet via a modem, cable-modem
		or ADSL connection but would be a good choice for any smallish network (up to
		1000 clients is known to work) where low resource use and ease of configuration
		are important.

		Dnsmasq provides the following features:
		- The DNS configuration of machines behind the firewall is simple and doesn't
		  depend on the details of the ISP's dns servers.
		- Clients which try to do DNS lookups while a modem link to the internet is down
		  will time out immediately.
		- Serve names from the /etc/hosts file on the firewall machine: If the names of
		  local machines are there, then they can all be addressed without having to maintain
		  /etc/hosts on each machine.
		- Supports static and dynamic DHCP leases and multiple networks and IP ranges.
		- Supports BOOTP/TFTP/PXE for network booting.
		- Machines which are configured by DHCP have their names automatically included in
		  the DNS and the names can specified by each machine or centrally by associating a
		  name with a MAC address in the dnsmasq config file.
		- Caches internet addresses (A records and AAAA records) and address-to-name mappings
		  (PTR records), reducing the load on upstream servers and improving performance
		  (especially on modem connections).
		- Can be configured to automatically pick up the addresses of its upstream nameservers
		  from ppp or dhcp configuration. It will automatically reload this information if it
		  changes. This facility will be of particular interest to maintainers of Linux firewall
		  distributions since it allows dns configuration to be made automatic.
		- Can both talk to upstream servers via IPv6 and offer DNS service via IPv6. On
		  dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) boxes it talks both protocols and can even act as
		  IPv6-to-IPv4 or IPv4-to-IPv6 forwarder.
		- Can be configured to send queries for certain domains to upstream servers handling
		  only those domains. This makes integration with private DNS systems easy.
		- Supports MX and SRV records and can be configured to return MX records for any or all
		  local machines.

		Example config file located at /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf.example
		dnsmask defaults to /etc/dnsmask.conf. To override the default, use:
			dnsmasq --conf-file=/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf  

		Built with CFLAGS: -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe
		Built with CXXFLAGS: -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe
		Built with LDFLAGS: -Wl,-O1
