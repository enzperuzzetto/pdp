Comments:	This extension depends on openssl-0.9.8.tcz and
		gcc_libs.tcz
		Config files are located at /usr/local/etc/ssh/
		Copy ssh_config.example and sshd_config.example to
		ssh_config and sshd_config AND EDIT to fit setup.
		
		**Warning: Default sshd_config contains possible
		security concerns.
		
		Host key files will need to be generated only
		if you intend to run a server.
		Use /usr/local/etc/init.d/openssh to start, stop or
		restart server and to generate host keys.
		
		This extension is PPI compatible
